# SQL Business Case Study

The SQL Business Case Study is a part of the **8-Week SQL Challenge**  created by [Data with Danny](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/). 

It consists of 8 case studies, each representing a unique business scenario. 

I undertook the challenge to showcase my proficiency in SQL and demonstrate my expertise in handling real-world data problems.
