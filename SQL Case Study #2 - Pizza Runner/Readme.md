# SQL Case Study #2 - Pizza Runner

## Data Cleaning & Transformation

### ðŸ”¨Â Table: customer_orders

Looking at theÂ `customer_orders`Â table below, we can see that there are

- In theÂ `exclusions`Â column, there are missing/ blank spaces ' ' and null values.
- In theÂ `extras`Â column, there are missing/ blank spaces ' ' and null values.

Our course of action to clean the table:

- Create a temporary table with all the columns
- Remove null values inÂ `exlusions`Â andÂ `extras`Â columns and replace with blank space ' '.

```sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE temp_customer_orders AS(
	SELECT
		order_id,
		customer_id,
		pizza_id,
		CASE
			WHEN exclusions IS null OR exclusions LIKE 'null' THEN ' '
			ELSE exclusions
			END AS exclusions,
	
		CASE(
			WHEN extras IS null OR extras LIKE 'null' THEN ' '
			ELSE extra
			END AS extras)
	FROM pizza_runner.customers_orders
);
```

This is how the cleanÂ `customers_orders_temp`Â table looks like and we will use this table to run all our queries.

### ðŸ”¨Â Table: runner_orders

Looking at theÂ `runner_orders`Â table below, we can see that there are

- In theÂ `exclusions`Â column, there are missing/ blank spaces ' ' and null values.
- In theÂ `extras`Â column, there are missing/ blank spaces ' ' and null values

!https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/129472585-badae450-52d2-442e-9d50-e4d0d8fce83a.png

Our course of action to clean the table:

- InÂ `pickup_time`Â column, remove nulls and replace with blank space ' '.
- InÂ `distance`Â column, remove "km" and nulls and replace with blank space ' '.
- InÂ `duration`Â column, remove "minutes", "minute" and nulls and replace with blank space ' '.
- InÂ `cancellation`Â column, remove NULL and null and and replace with blank space ' '.

```sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE temp_runner_orders AS(
	SELECT
		order_id,
		runner_id
		CASE
			WHEN pickup_time LIKE 'null' THEN ' '
			ELSE pickup_time
			END AS pickup_time,
		CASE
			WHEN distance LIKE 'null' THEN ' '
			WHEN distance LIKE '%km' THEN TRIM('km' from duration)
			ELSE distance
			END AS distance,
		CASE
			WHEN duration LIKE 'null' THEN ' '
			WHEN duration LIKE '%minutes' THEN TRIM ('minutes' from duration)
			WHEN duration LIKE '%minute' THEN TRIM('minute' from duration)
			WHEN duration LIKE '%mins' THEN TRIM('mins' from duration)
			ELSE duration
			END AS duration,
		CASE
			WHEN cancellation IS NULL OR cancellation LIKE 'null' THEN ' '
			ELSE cancellation
			END AS cancellation
	FROM pizza_runner.runner_orders
);
```

Now, letâ€™s convert `**pickup_time**`, `**distance**` and `**duration**` to the correct data types. 

```sql
ALTER TABLE temp_runner_orders
ALTER COLUMN pickup_time DATETIME,
ALTER COLUMN distance FLOAT,
ALTER COLUMN duration INT;
```

This is how the table `**temp_runner_orders**` looks like and we run all our queries.
